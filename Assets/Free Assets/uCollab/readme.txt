Multiplayer development in the Unity editor is often hard and time consuming. 
Many developers have discovered that it takes a lot of time to build, run and 
test multiplayer games. The fact is that the Unity editor has very limited 
support for this development scenario. 

This is where uCollab enters the stage. It is small and free, yet very powerful. 
It has already saved tons of time for our team and several happy customers. We 
who made uCollab are also responsible for uLink, a network engine for Unity.

When using the uCollab plugin you run your game server in one Unity editor and 
the game client in another Unity editor. The plugin keeps assets and editor 
settings completely synchronized between the two. Make changes in the master 
editor and they will be synchronized to the slave editor(s), instantly.

For example, run a client in one editor, a game server in a second editor and 
another client in a third editor. They will all be synchronized by uCollab. The 
best part is that all the normal Unity editor tools are available; profiler, 
clickable console messages, Scene view, Game view, the possibility to view and 
change any public properties during playmode, and so on.

With this simple and free tool you actually get a completely distributed test 
environment. It is possible to synchronize as many editors as needed, one master 
and several slaves.

Any Unity multiplayer developer can now be equipped with a distributed test tool. 
Who can resist to try it?

Requirements
This uCollab Free release requires Windows and Unity Pro 
(but will support Mac when finished).
uCollab works just fine with all network engines that are available for Unity. 
uLink is not required, but recommended. :-)
